The more I try to learn, the more stupid I feel
The more I work, the more exhausting I feel
The more I code, the more stucks I feel
The more I try to sleep, the more wakefulness I feel
The more I eat, the more hungriness I feel
The more I wanna happiness, the more worry I feel

The more the less, the less the more ...
