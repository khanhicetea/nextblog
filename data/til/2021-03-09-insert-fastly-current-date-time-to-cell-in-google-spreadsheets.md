Yo! Back to my #TIL

Today, I find out a way to insert fastly current date or current time to a cell. It makes you faster 3-5 seconds and reduce confusing about what the time is?

- To insert current date : press `Ctrl + :`
- To insert current time : press `Ctrl + Shift + :`

> Excel (Spreadsheets) never dies !
